# Project
Capstone
This is a test

This project takes a CSV file, enter all the number values into a formula, then adds the sum. The updated indo is then added to a dictionary. Creates a new
.txt file and sorts the file (key:Value) by Value from highest value to lowest value. Then sends an email to an email list and has the ability to identify 
valid and invalid email addresses. Also the .txt file is attached with a message a subject line. When the mail is sent it will print "Mail Sent". In the
main function all the functions will be called upon and also a while loop will start to send an email every time at 0700.
